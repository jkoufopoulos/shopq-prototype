You are analyzing a ShopQ email digest to identify format and categorization issues.

Compare the ACTUAL digest output against the IDEAL format structure.

## IDEAL DIGEST FORMAT

The digest MUST match this exact format - flag ANY deviations in structure, styling, content presentation, or formatting.

```
🚨 CRITICAL (X emails):
  • Bills due soon
  • Security alerts
  • Account alerts
  • Low balance warnings
  • Statement availability (if actionable)

📦 TODAY (X emails):
  • Package deliveries arriving today
  • Urgent deadlines today
  • Time-sensitive notifications

📅 COMING UP (X emails):
  • Appointments in next 7 days
  • Events scheduled
  • Tasks due soon
  • Meetings

💼 WORTH KNOWING (X emails):
  • Job postings
  • Shipment notifications (not arriving today)
  • Financial updates (non-critical)
  • Professional updates

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Everything else (X emails):
  • 18 promotional (sales, offers, surveys)
  • 12 past events (yesterday, concluded, finished)
  • 33 updates & notifications (routine)
```

**Required format characteristics:**
- ✅ Simple bullet points (•) with item titles and numbered links: `• Title (1)`
- ✅ Exact emojis: 🚨📦📅💼 (not ⏰ or other variants)
- ✅ Plain text, no styled boxes or gray backgrounds
- ✅ No email snippets or preview text
- ✅ No `<div class="category-summaries">` or expandable sections
- ✅ Items appear ONCE only, not duplicated in different formats

## ANTI-PATTERNS (What Should NOT Exist)

**❌ Duplicate Content**: Same items appearing multiple times in different formats

Bad example:
```html
<!-- First occurrence: Inline in narrative -->
<div class="content">
  🚨 CRITICAL
  • Bill due Nov 12 (1)
  📅 COMING UP
  • Dentist appointment (2)
</div>

<!-- Second occurrence: Styled boxes -->
<div class="category-summaries">
  <div class="category-section">
    <div class="category-title">🚨 CRITICAL</div>
    <li>(1) Bill due Nov 12 <snippet>...</snippet></li>
  </div>
  <div class="category-section">
    <div class="category-title">⏰ Coming Up</div>
    <li>(2) Dentist appointment <snippet>...</snippet></li>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Problem**: Items (1) and (2) appear TWICE - once inline, once in styled boxes.

## ACTUAL DIGEST OUTPUT

{actual_digest}

## YOUR TASK

Analyze the actual digest and identify format/categorization issues:

### 1. STRUCTURE & FORMAT ISSUES
- Is the digest using categorized sections (🚨📦📅💼) or a numbered list (1. 2. 3.)?
- Are all 4 required sections present?
- Is there an "Everything else" separator (━━━━)?
- **Does content appear multiple times?** (Check for items appearing both inline AND in `category-summaries` div)
- **Is there a `<div class="category-summaries">` element?** (Should NOT exist - this creates duplicate content)
- **Are items formatted as simple bullets (`• Title (1)`) or as styled boxes?** (Should be simple bullets only)
- **Do items include email snippets or preview text?** (Should NOT - only title and link number)
- **Are section emojis correct?** (Must be exactly 🚨📦📅💼, not ⏰ or other variants)
- **Are items in gray boxes with backgrounds?** (Should NOT - plain text only)
- **Is content in expandable sections?** (Should NOT - all content inline)

### 2. CATEGORIZATION ISSUES
- Are promotional emails (vote, feedback, surveys) in main list instead of "Everything else"?
- Are past events (yesterday, concluded, adjourned) in main list instead of "Everything else"?
- Are deliveries in TODAY section (or featured at all)?
- Are appointments in COMING UP section?
- Are bills/alerts in CRITICAL section?

### 3. PRIORITY ISSUES
- Are routine notifications elevated to main sections?
- Are critical items (bills, security) missing from featured areas?
- Is the relative importance correct (CRITICAL > TODAY > COMING UP > WORTH KNOWING)?

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Return a JSON array of issues. Each issue should have:

```json
{
  "severity": "high|medium|low",
  "category": "digest_format",
  "pattern": "Brief description of the issue",
  "evidence": "Specific examples from actual digest (quote items)",
  "root_cause": "Why this is happening",
  "suggested_fix": "Specific action to fix it"
}
```

### SEVERITY GUIDELINES

- **high**: Structural problems (missing sections, wrong format), **duplicate content**, **styled boxes instead of bullets**, **email snippets present**, critical items missing, noise heavily featured, wrong emojis used
- **medium**: Some miscategorization, promotional items in main list, past events featured, minor formatting deviations
- **low**: Minor category placement issues, edge cases, acceptable alternate wording

### IMPORTANT

- **Flag ANY deviation from the ideal format** - structure, styling, formatting, content presentation, emojis, duplicates
- Provide specific evidence with quotes/HTML from actual digest
- Focus on actionable problems with clear fixes
- Compare actual HTML structure against ideal format requirements
- If digest matches ideal format exactly, return empty array []

Return ONLY the JSON array, no other text.
