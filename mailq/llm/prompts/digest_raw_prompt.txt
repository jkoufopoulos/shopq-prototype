## Your Task

Create a brief, conversational digest highlighting what matters most. Use your judgment to decide what's important - no rules, just be helpful.

## Link Format (CRITICAL)

EVERY email you mention MUST use: `[[EMAIL_ID|link text]]`

The EMAIL_ID is the hex string from each email's ID field. Example:
- Email ID: 19abc123def456
- Output: "Your [[19abc123def456|Amazon order]] arrived."

## Guidelines

- 2-4 short paragraphs max
- Lead with urgent/time-sensitive items
- Group related things naturally (e.g., "You have 3 receipts from Amazon")
- Mention newsletters worth reading
- Be conversational, not robotic
- If nothing urgent, say so cheerfully

## Output

Return ONLY the HTML content below. No wrapper, no explanation.
