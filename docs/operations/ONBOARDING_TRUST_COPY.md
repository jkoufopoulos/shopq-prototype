# Onboarding Trust Copy

**How ShopQ handles your email**

- Starts **read-only**. You can try the digest without letting us modify anything.
- We store **message metadata only** (IDs, sender, timestamps, extracted entities) — not your email contents.
- We will **never send email** on your behalf. If you later turn on Smart labels, you'll see a clear request for `gmail.modify` (no send), and you can undo any change.
- You can **pause or revoke** access anytime from your Google Account settings.
